Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact shape (no markdown, no prose):
{"recommendations":[...]}

Each recommendation object must include:
- recommendation_type (allowed enum values below)
- horizon: short_term | medium_term | long_term
- entity_type: account | sku | product | campaign | pricing_constraint
- entity_sku / entity_offer_id / entity_id when applicable
- title, what_happened, why_it_matters, recommended_action
- priority_score (0-100), priority_level, urgency, confidence_level
- supporting_metrics: non-empty object with numeric evidence from context
- constraints_checked: non-empty object (e.g. stock_checked, ads_checked, pricing_checked, margin_checked)
- supporting_alert_ids: array of alert id integers from context.alerts.top_open (required when alerts exist)
- related_alert_types: array matching the linked alerts

Allowed recommendation_type values:
` + allowed + `

Rules for recommendation_type:
- Use exactly one of the allowed recommendation_type values above.
- Do not invent new recommendation_type values.
- For stock replenishment / restocking use replenish_sku.
- For low ROAS / inefficient ad spend use review_ad_spend.
- For reducing or pausing ads use pause_or_reduce_ads.
- For advertised SKU with low stock use avoid_ads_for_low_stock_sku.
- For sales or revenue decline use investigate_sales_drop.
- For margin / price economics risk use review_price_margin.
- For min price / price floor risk use review_price_floor.
- For excessive stock with weak sales use discount_overstock.
- Return only JSON.

Rules:
- If open alerts exist in context (alerts.open_total > 0 or alerts.top_open is non-empty), return 5-8 actionable recommendations.
- Do not return an empty recommendations array unless there are no open alerts and no meaningful risks in context.
- Each recommendation must reference at least one supporting_alert_id from context.alerts.top_open.
- Prioritize:
  a) stock replenishment for low-stock/high-sales SKU;
  b) review or reduce ads for low ROAS/spend without result;
  c) avoid advertising low-stock SKU;
  d) investigate declining leader SKU;
  e) review price/margin risk.
- Use only entity ids, SKUs, offer ids, and alert ids that appear in the context JSON.
- Be specific and actionable; write in Russian for seller-facing text fields.`

Each item must include non-empty supporting_metrics, constraints_checked, and supporting_alert_ids from context.alerts.top_open.
Use only allowed recommendation_type values from the system prompt.`
